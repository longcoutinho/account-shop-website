              ElitaGame GDPR & LGPD Privacy Policy ElitaGame respects the data
              subject’s privacy and works hard to safeguard the privacy of the
              data subject’s personal data. We realize that the exciting growth
              of the Internet and online services raise questions concerning the
              nature, use and confidentiality of information collected about
              consumers. We want the data subject to know that we apply our
              long-standing commitment of safeguarding privacy to our online and
              Internet activities.
              <br />
              By providing Personal Information to us, the data subject
              isconsenting to this Privacy Statement and the collection, use,
              access, transfer, storage and processing of the data subject’s
              personal information as described in this Privacy Statement.
              <br />
              The use of the Internet pages of ElitaGame is possible without any
              indication of personal data; however, if a data subject wants to
              use our services on the Portals, including, without limitation,
              reselling and retailing online games and related merchandises or
              games publishing, processing of personal data could become
              necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary and
              there is no statutory basis for such processing, we will obtain
              the data subject’s consent.
              <br />
              The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail
              address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in
              line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in
              accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations
              applicable to ElitaGame. By means of this data protection
              declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general
              public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we
              collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed,
              by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to
              which they are entitled.
              <br />
              As the controller, ElitaGame has implemented numerous technical
              and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection
              of personal data processed through the Portals. However,
              Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security
              gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this
              reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us
              via alternative means, e.g. by telephone.
              <br />
              In addition to GDPR, please note that we collect, store and handle
              personal information of individuals in accordance with the
              Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (“PDPA”) and the laws of
              Singapore. We are also in full compliance with the Lei Geral de
              Proteção de Dados (LGPD), which means the data subject can follow
              the LGPD process if the data subject want us to provide the data
              subject with a copy, make correction or remove the data subject’s
              data. Since we process data of individuals who are within the
              territory of Brazil, the Brazilian LGPD applies to our processing
              of the data subject’s Personal Data.
              <br />
              Please read the Privacy Statement below to understand how we use
              the personal information we may collect from the data subject. We
              will not use or share the data subject’s information with anyone
              except as described in this Privacy Policy.
              <br />

              1. Definitions
            </p>
            <p>
              The data protection declaration of ElitaGame is based on the terms
              used by the European legislator for the adoption of the General
              Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection declaration
              should be legible and understandable for the general public, as
              well as our customers and partners. To ensure this, we would like
              to begin by explaining the terminology used.
              <br />
              In this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the
              following terms:
              <br />
              • Personal data
              <br />
              Personal data means any information relating to an identified or
              identifiable natural person (“data subject”). An identifiable
              natural person is one who can be identified, directly or
              indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a
              name, an identification number, location data, an online
              identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical,
              physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social
              identity of that natural person.
              <br />
              • Data subject
              <br />
              Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person,
              whose personal data is processed by ElitaGame.
              <br />
              • Processing
              <br />
              Processing is any operation or set of operations which is
              performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or
              not by automated means, such as collection, recording,
              organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration,
              retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission,
              dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or
              combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.
              <br />
              • Restriction of processing
              <br />
              Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data
              with the aim of limiting their processing in the future.
              <br />
              • Profiling
              <br />
              Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data
              consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain
              personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to
              analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person’s
              performance at work, economic situation, health, personal
              preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or
              movements.
              <br />
              • Pseudonymisation
              <br />
              Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a
              manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a
              specific data subject without the use of additional information,
              provided that such additional information is kept separately and
              is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that
              the personal data are not attributed to an identified or
              identifiable natural person.
              <br />
              • Controller or controller responsible for the processing
              <br />
              Controller or controller responsible for the processing is the
              natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body
              which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and
              means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and
              means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State
              law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination
              may be provided for by Union or Member State law.
              <br />
              • Processor
              <br />
              Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency
              or other body which processes personal data on behalf of
              ElitaGame.
              <br />
              • Recipient
              <br />
              Recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency
              or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether
              a third party or not. However, public authorities which may
              receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in
              accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as
              recipients; the processing of those data by those public
              authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data
              protection rules according to the purposes of the processing.
              <br />
              • Third party
              <br />
              Third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency
              or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and
              persons who, under the direct authority of ElitaGame or processor,
              are authorised to process personal data.
              <br />
              • Consent
              <br />
              Consent of the data subject is any freely given, specific,
              informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes
              by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative
              action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data
              relating to him or her.
              <br />
              Other capitalized terms not defined above, shall have the meaning
              granted to it in our Terms of Services.

            </p>
            <p>
              We value each data subject’s trust in providing us their personal
              information.
              <br />
              A customer's name, address (postal and e-mail) and telephone
              number are the most important pieces of information, but we might
              request other information, based on, for example, the Service(s)
              being ordered or promoted.
              <br />
              SHARING, DISCLOSURE, AND SALE OF PERSONAL DATA
              <br />
              ElitaGame does not share, disclose or sell any
              personally-identifiable information (such as the data subject’s
              name, address, telephone number or e-mail address) collected
              online on ElitaGame' Portals with other unaffiliated companies or
              organizations for non-ElitaGame marketing purposes. Because this
              information is a critical part of our business, it would be
              treated like our other assets in the context of a merger, sale or
              other corporate reorganization or legal proceeding.
              <br />
              We will only provide personally-identifiable online information in
              response to subpoenas and other legal demands, and where we
              believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify,
              contact or bring legal action against individuals who may be
              endangering public safety or interfering with ElitaGame' services,
              or with our customers' or others' use of them.
              <br />
              DISCLOSURE OF THE DATA SUBJECT’S INFORMATION (IF NEEDED)
              <br />
              When the data subject has provided personal information to us for
              a particular purpose, we may disclose the data subject’s
              information to other companies that we have engaged to assist us
              in fulfilling the data subject’s request. This may include, but is
              not limited to, fulfillment houses, billing services, transaction
              managers, credit verification services, and other third-party
              service providers. We may also disclose any of the data subject’s
              personal information to law enforcement or other appropriate third
              parties in connection with criminal investigations, investigation
              of fraud, infringement of intellectual property rights, or other
              suspected illegal activities, or as otherwise may be required by
              applicable law, or, as we deem necessary in our sole discretion,
              in order to protect the legitimate legal interests of ElitaGame.
              <br />
              INFORMATION OF CHILDREN AND UNDERAGE ADOLESCENTS
              <br />
              Children and underage adolescents may be users of our products and
              Services, provided that they are duly authorized by their parents
              or guardians or that their parents or guardians act on their
              behalf. In the event that their parents or guardians of these
              children become aware of an unauthorized data processing, they may
              submit their inquiries or complaints to support@ElitaGame.com.
              <br />
              WHEN DO WE COLLECT THE DATA SUBJECT’S PERSONAL INFORMATION?
              <br />
              We may collect personal information directly from data subjects
              when they:
              <br />
              • Communicate with us (for example when the data subjects submit
              an application form to become our customer, or when they contact
              us for any enquiries including by calling our customer
              service,registering for an Account, using our Portals' Services or
              receiving our publications (for example, newsletters);
              <br />
              • Participate in any of our surveys;
              <br />
              • Enter into or participate in any competitions, contests or
              loyalty programs run/organized by ElitaGame;
              <br />
              • Register interest and/or request for information of (through our
              online portals or other available channels) or subscribe to our
              products and/or Services;
              <br />
              • Respond to any marketing materials we send out;
              <br />
              • Visit or browse our Portals;
              <br />
              • Lodge a complaint with us; and/or
              <br />
              • Provide feedback to us (for example via our Portals or in hard
              copy).
              <br />
              Other than personal information obtained from the data subject
              directly (as detailed above), we may also obtain data subject’s
              personal information from third parties we deal with or are
              connected with the data subject (credit reference agencies or
              financial institutions), and from such other sources where the
              data subject has given their consent for the disclosure of
              information relating to the data subject, and/or where otherwise
              lawfully permitted.
              <br />
              HOW DO WE COLLECT THE DATA SUBJECT’S PERSONAL INFORMATION?
              <br />
              ElitaGame collects information online by asking the data subject
              for it, for example, when the data subject orders a Service,
              applies for a job, or responds to a survey, offer or other
              promotion.
              <br />
              Cookies:ElitaGame may also use "cookies" and similar technology to
              obtain information about the data subject’s visits to our Portals
              or the data subject’s responses to e-mail from us - both
              individually and in aggregated data that does not identify the
              data subject. These reporting tools tell us the parts of our
              Portals or e-mails in which the data subject showed an interest or
              took some action, and help us improve the quality and usefulness
              of our Portals.
              <br />
              Content: Data subjects also provide us information in content they
              post to the Portals. The data subject’s content (such as reviews,
              photos and videos) and metadata about the data subject’s content
              will be viewed by other users. ElitaGame can, but has no
              obligation, to monitor the content data subjects post on the
              Portals. We can remove any information data subjects post for any
              reason or no reason.
              <br />
              Payment Method: Data subjects will also be asked to submit
              Personal Information depending on the payment method data subjects
              choose when accessing, purchasing or subscribing to one of our
              products or Services. For example, if the data subject chooses to
              pay for a product/service by credit card, the data subject will be
              required to provide us the name of the data subject’s credit card
              issuer, credit card number, billing address, CVV number, and
              expiration date.
              <br />
              Log Files: When data subjects use the Portals, our servers
              automatically record certain information sent by the data
              subject’s web browser. These server logs may include information
              such as the data subject’s web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”)
              address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of
              clicks and how the data subject interacts with links on the
              Portals, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, mobile
              carrier, and other such information.
              <br />
              Geo-Location Information: When data subjects use the Portals by or
              through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or
              remotely store “location data,” which may include GPS coordinates
              (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding
              the location of the data subject’s mobile device.
              <br />
              Third Party Tools: ElitaGame uses third party analytics tools, to
              help understand use of the Portals. Many of these tools collect
              the information sent by the data subject’s browser as part of a
              web page request, including cookies and the data subject’s IP
              address. These analytics tools also receive this information and
              their use of it is governed by their privacy policy.
              <br />
              HOW DO WE USE THE DATA SUBJECT’S INFORMATION ElitaGame uses the
              personally-identifiable information collected online principally
              to provide data subjects with the service(s) data subjects have
              ordered and to let data subjects know about other offerings which
              may be of interest to data subjects. Postal and e-mail address
              information, for example, enables communication about services
              offered and ordered, as well as the proper provisioning and
              billing of those services. At any point of time, should the data
              subject feel the need to opt-out of future communications with
              ElitaGame, options are given within the data subject’s Account to
              exclude those communicated messages to the data subject.
              <br />
              WHAT WE REQUEST FROM DATA SUBJECTS We request for data subjects to
              provide us accurate and complete information about themselves and
              any other person whose personal information the data subject
              provides us. We further request that data subjects update the
              information that they have provided us when it becomes incorrect
              or out of date by contacting us. This obligation is a condition to
              the provision of our Services to data subjects and/or any other
              person authorized or permitted by the data subject or the data
              subject’s organization/company to use the products and/or
              Services.
              <br />
              WE PROMISE PRIVACY & SECURITY Both of us together play an
              important role in protecting against online fraud. The data
              subject should be careful that any information including their
              User ID, Password, or Security Code are not compromised by
              ensuring that each data subject does not knowingly or accidentally
              share, provide or facilitate unauthorized use of it. Do not share;
              <br />
              • User ID – each data subject and every account user will receive
              a unique identifier.
              <br />
              • Password - is the passphrase that each data subject uses to
              access our Services.
              <br />
              • Security Code - sent to each data subject to verify the data
              subject’s access to our Services.
              <br />
              At ElitaGame, we use encryption, firewalls and other technology
              and security procedures to help protect the accuracy and security
              of the data subject’s personal information and prevent
              unauthorized access or improper use. For example, data subjects
              will note that while using some features of the ElitaGame's
              Portal, data subjects will need to submit a password or some other
              type of authenticating information.
              <br />
              NOTICES TO THE CHANGES IN PRIVACY POLICIES
              <br />
              ElitaGame reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any
              time by notifying registered users via e-mail of the existence of
              a new Privacy Policy and/or posting the new Privacy Policy on
              ElitaGame' Portals. All changes to the Privacy Policy will be
              effective when posted, and the data subject’s continued use of
              ElitaGame, product or service after the posting will constitute
              the data subject’s acceptance of, and agreement to be bound by,
              those changes.

              4.Data protection provisions about the use of ElitaGame
            </p>
            <p>
              • We use a tracking pixel. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic
              embedded in a web page to enable log file recording and log file
              analysis to subsequently perform a statistical analysis. ElitaGame
              also sets a cookie on the information technology system of the
              data subject. The definition of cookies is explained above. The
              setting of the cookie enables us to analyze the usage of our
              Portals. Using the data obtained, usage profiles are created. The
              usage profiles are used for the purpose of analyzing visitor
              behavior and enabling an improvement of our Internet offer. Data
              collected through the ElitaGame component are not used to identify
              the data subject without first obtaining a separate and explicit
              consent from the data subject. These data will not be merged with
              personal data or with other data which contains the same usage
              profile. By default, ElitaGame identifies the companies, not the
              individuals, who are accessing the Portals, and presents
              firmographic information. Personal information is only collected
              and stored based on opt-in preferences.
              <br />
              With each call-up to one of the individual pages of the Portals,
              the Internet browser on the information technology system of the
              data subject is programmatically requested to submit data for the
              purpose of online analysis to the ElitaGame component. During the
              course of this technical procedure, ElitaGame gains knowledge of
              visitor information, such as the requesting IP address, which
              inter alia, serves to understand the origin of visitors and
              clicks.
              <br />
              The cookie is used to store anonymized information, such as the
              access time, and the frequency of visits to our Portals. With each
              visit of our Internet pages, these visitor data, including the IP
              address of the Internet access used by the data subject, are
              logged and stored by the ElitaGame server.
              <br />
              The data subject may prevent the setting of cookies through our
              Portals at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the
              web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.
              Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent
              ElitaGame from setting a cookie on the information technology
              system of the data subject. In addition, cookies already in use by
              ElitaGame may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other
              software programs.If ElitaGame chooses “ElitaGame” as lead
              identification option for their website, we might transmit
              personal data of the data subject to our processors. By
              implementing this lead identification option, the data subject
              agrees to the transfer of personal data required for lead
              identification. The personal data transmitted to ElitaGame is
              usually first name, last name, email address, IP address,
              telephone number, mobile phone number, or other data necessary for
              lead identification processing. The transmission of the data is
              aimed at lead identification. ElitaGame can transfer personal data
              to our processors, in particular, if a legitimate interest in the
              product or Service is given.
              <br />
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "20px", fontWeight: "600" }}>5. Cookies</p>
            <p>
              The Portals use cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in
              a computer system via an Internet browser.
              <br />
              Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain
              a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the
              cookie. It consists of a character string through which Internet
              pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser
              in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites
              and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the subject
              from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A
              specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using
              the unique cookie ID.
              <br />
              Through the use of cookies, ElitaGame can provide the users of the
              Portals with more user-friendly services that would not be
              possible without the cookie setting.
              <br />
              By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our Portals
              can be optimized with the user in mind. Cookies allow us, as
              previously mentioned, to recognize our Portals users. The purpose
              of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our
              Portals. The Portal user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to
              enter access data (login credentials) each time the Portals is
              accessed, because this is taken over by the Portals, and the
              cookie is thus stored on the user’s computer system. In other
              words, it is not necessary to login again every time a new page is
              requested (a click). Another example is the cookie of a shopping
              cart in an online shop. The online store remembers the articles
              that a customer has placed in the digital shopping cart via a
              cookie.
              <br />
              The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies
              through our Portals by means of a corresponding setting of the
              Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting
              of cookies. Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any
              time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is
              possible in all popular Internet browsers. If the data subject
              deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used,
              not all functions of our Portals may be entirely usable.
              <br />

              6. Collection of general data and information
            </p>
            <p>
              The Portals of ElitaGame collects a series of general data and
              information when a data subject or automated system calls up the
              Portals. This general data and information are stored in the
              server log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and
              versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing
              system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our
              Portals (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date
              and time (so-called timestamp) of access to the Internet site, (6)
              an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the internet
              service provider (ISP) of the accessing system, and (8) any other
              similar data and information that may be used in the event of
              attacks on our information technology systems.
              <br />
              When using these general data and information, ElitaGame does not
              draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this
              information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our Portals
              correctly, (2) optimize the content of our Portals as well as its
              advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our
              information technology systems and website technology, and (4)
              provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary
              for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore,
              ElitaGame analyzes anonymously collected data and information
              statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and
              data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of
              protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of
              the server log files are stored separately from all personal data
              provided by a data subject.

              7. Registration on our Portals
            </p>
            <p>
              The data subject has the possibility to register on the Portals
              with the indication of personal data. Which personal data are
              transmitted ElitaGame is determined by the respective sign-up form
              used for the registration which can be obtained from
              https://account.ElitaGame.com/sso/login. The personal data entered
              by the data subject are collected and stored exclusively for
              internal use by ElitaGame, and for his own purposes. ElitaGame may
              request transfer to one or more processors that also uses personal
              data for an internal purpose which is attributable to ElitaGame.
              <br />
              By registering on the Portals of ElitaGame, the IP
              address—assigned by the internet service provider (ISP) and used
              by the data subject—date, and time of the registration are also
              stored. The storage of this data takes place against the
              background that this is the only way to prevent the misuse of our
              Services, and, if necessary, to make it possible to investigate
              committed offenses. ElitaGame stores such data only insofar, the
              storage of this data is necessary to secure ElitaGame. This data
              is not passed on to third parties unless there is a statutory
              obligation to pass on the data, or if the transfer serves the aim
              of criminal prosecution.
              <br />
              The registration of the data subject, with the voluntary
              indication of personal data, is intended to enable ElitaGame to
              offer the data subject contents or services that may only be
              offered to registered users due to the nature of the matter in
              question. Registered persons are free to change the personal data
              specified during the registration at any time, or to have them
              completely deleted from the data stock of ElitaGame.
              <br />
              The data controller shall, at any time, provide information upon
              request to each data subject as to what personal data are stored
              about the data subject. In addition, the data controller shall
              correct or erase personal data at the request or indication of the
              data subject, insofar as there are no statutory storage
              obligations. A Data Protection Officer particularly designated in
              this data protection declaration, as well as the entirety of
              ElitaGame’s employees are available to the data subject in this
              respect as contact persons.

              8. Subscription to our newsletters
            </p>
            <p>
              On the Portals of ElitaGame, users are given the opportunity to
              subscribe to our newsletter. The input section used for this
              purpose determines what personal data are transmitted, as well as
              when the newsletter is ordered from ElitaGame.
              <br />
              ElitaGame informs its customers and partners regularly by means of
              a newsletter about product offers. The enterprise’s newsletter may
              only be received by the data subject if (1) the data subject has a
              valid e-mail address and (2) the data subject registers for the
              newsletter shipping. A confirmation e-mail will be sent to the
              e-mail address registered by a data subject for the first time for
              newsletter shipping, for legal reasons, in the double opt-in
              procedure. This confirmation e-mail is used to prove whether the
              owner of the e-mail address as the data subject is authorized to
              receive the newsletter.
              <br />
              During the registration for the newsletter, we also store the IP
              address of the computer system assigned by the internet service
              provider (ISP) and used by the data subject at the time of the
              registration, as well as the date and time of the registration.
              The collection of this data is necessary in order to understand
              the (possible) misuse of the e-mail address of a data subject at a
              later date, and it therefore serves the aim of the legal
              protection of ElitaGame.
              <br />
              The personal data collected as part of a registration for the
              newsletter will only be used to send our newsletter. In addition,
              subscribers to the newsletter may be informed by e-mail, as long
              as this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service
              or a registration in question, as this could be the case in the
              event of modifications to the newsletter offer, or in the event of
              a change in technical circumstances. There will be no transfer of
              personal data collected by the newsletter service to third
              parties. The subscription to our newsletter may be terminated by
              the data subject at any time. The consent to the storage of
              personal data, which the data subject has given for shipping the
              newsletter, may be revoked at any time. For the purpose of
              revocation of consent, a corresponding link (‘unsubscribe’) is
              found in each newsletter. It is also possible to unsubscribe from
              the newsletter at any time directly on our Portals, or to
              communicate this to us in a different way.

              9. Newsletter-Tracking
            </p>
            <p>
              The newsletter of ElitaGame contains tracking pixels. A tracking
              pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in such e-mails, which are
              sent in HTML format to enable log file recording and analysis.
              This allows a statistical analysis of the success or failure of
              online marketing campaigns. Based on the embedded tracking pixel,
              ElitaGame may see if and when an e-mail was opened by a data
              subject, and which links in the e-mail were called up (clicked on)
              by data subjects.
              <br />
              Such personal data collected in the tracking pixels contained in
              the newsletters are stored and analyzed by ElitaGame in order to
              optimize the shipping of the newsletter, as well as to
              continuously adapt the content of future newsletters to the

              • Right to erasure (Right to be forgotten)
              <br />
              Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European
              legislator to obtain from ElitaGame the erasure of personal data
              concerning him or her without undue delay, and ElitaGame shall
              have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay
              where one of the following grounds applies, as long as the
              processing is not necessary:
              <br />
              1. The personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the
              purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.
              <br />
              2. The data subject withdraws consent to which the processing is
              based according to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, or point
              (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where there is no other legal
              ground for the processing.
              <br />
              3. The data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article
              21(1) of the GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds
              for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing
              pursuant to Article 21(2) of the GDPR.
              <br />
              4. The personal data have been unlawfully processed.
              <br />
              5. The personal data must be erased for compliance with a legal
              obligation in Union or Member State law to which ElitaGame is
              subject.
              <br />
              6. The personal data have been collected in relation to the offer
              of information society services referred to in Article 8(1) of the
              GDPR.
              <br />
              If one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data subject
              wishes to request the erasure of personal data stored by
              ElitaGame, he or she may at any time contact our Data Protection
              Officer or another employee of ElitaGame. The Data Protection
              Officer of ElitaGame or another employee shall promptly ensure
              that the erasure request is complied with immediately.
              <br />
              Where ElitaGame has made personal data public and is obliged
              pursuant to Article 17(1) to erase the personal data, ElitaGame,
              taking account of available technology and the cost of
              implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical
              measures, to inform other controllers processing the personal data
              that the data subject has requested erasure by such controllers of
              any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data, as
              far as processing is not required. The Data Protection Officer of
              ElitaGame or another employee will arrange the necessary measures
              in individual cases.
              <br />
              • Right of restriction of processing
              <br />
              Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European
              legislator to obtain from ElitaGame restriction of processing
              where one of the following applies:
              <br />
              1. The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data
              subject, for a period enabling ElitaGame to verify the accuracy of
              the personal data.
              <br />
              2. The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the
              erasure of the personal data and requests instead the restriction
              of their use instead.
              <br />
              3. ElitaGame no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of
              the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the
              establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
              <br />
              4. The data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article
              21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether the legitimate
              grounds of ElitaGame override those of the data subject.
              <br />
              If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject
              wishes to request the restriction of the processing of personal
              data stored by ElitaGame, he or she may at any time contact our
              Data Protection Officer or another employee of ElitaGame. The Data
              Protection Officer of ElitaGame or another employee will arrange
              the restriction of the processing.
              <br />
              • Right to data portability
              <br />
              Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European
              legislator, to receive the personal data concerning him or her,
              which was provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used
              and machine-readable format. He or she shall have the right to
              transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from
              ElitaGame to which the personal data have been provided, as long
              as the processing is based on consent pursuant to point (a) of
              Article 6(1) of the GDPR or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR,
              or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of Article 6(1) of the
              GDPR, and the processing is carried out by automated means, as
              long as the processing is not necessary for the performance of a
              task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
              official authority vested in ElitaGame.
              <br />
              Furthermore, in exercising his or her right to data portability
              pursuant to Article 20(1) of the GDPR, the data subject shall have
              the right to have personal data transmitted directly from one
              controller to another, where technically feasible and when doing
              so does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
              <br />
              In order to assert the right to data portability, the data subject
              may at any time contact the Data Protection Officer designated by
              ElitaGame or another employee.
              <br />
              • Right to object
              <br />
              Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European
              legislator to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular
              situation, at any time, to processing of personal data concerning
              him or her, which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) of
              the GDPR. This also applies to profiling based on these
              provisions.
              <br />
              ElitaGame shall no longer process the personal data in the event
              of the objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate
              grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights
              and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment,
              exercise or defence of legal claims.
              <br />
              If ElitaGame processes personal data for direct marketing
              purposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at any
              time to processing of personal data concerning him or her for such
              marketing. This applies to profiling to the extent that it is
              related to such direct marketing. If the data subject objects to
              ElitaGame to the processing for direct marketing purposes, the
              data subject could inform ElitaGame to exclude the subject from
              any direct marketing approach and ElitaGame will no longer process
              the personal data for these purposes.
              <br />
              In addition, the data subject has the right, on grounds relating
              to his or her particular situation, to object to processing of
              personal data concerning him or her by ElitaGame for scientific or
              historical research purposes, or for statistical purposes pursuant
              to Article 89(1) of the GDPR, unless the processing is necessary
              for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public
              interest.
              <br />
              In order to exercise the right to object, the data subject may
              directly contact the Data Protection Officer of ElitaGame or
              another employee. In addition, the data subject is free in the
              context of the use of information society services, and
              notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, to use his or her right to
              object by automated means using technical specifications.
              <br />
              • Automated individual decision-making, including profiling
              <br />
              Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European
              legislator not to be subject to a decision based solely on
              automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal
              effects concerning him or her, or similarly significantly affects
              him or her, as long as the decision (1) is not is necessary for
              entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data
              subject and a data controller, or (2) is not authorised by Union
              or Member State law to which ElitaGame is subject and which also
              lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject’s rights
              and freedoms and legitimate interests, or (3) is not based on the
              data subject’s explicit consent.
              <br />
              If the decision (1) is necessary for entering into, or the
              performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data
              controller, or (2) it is based on the data subject’s explicit
              consent, ElitaGame shall implement suitable measures to safeguard
              the data subject’s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests,
              at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of
              ElitaGame, to express his or her point of view and contest the
              decision.
              <br />
              If the data subject wishes to exercise the rights concerning
              automated individual decision-making, he or she may at any time
              directly contact our Data Protection Officer of ElitaGame or
              another employee of ElitaGame.
              <br />
              • Right to withdraw data protection consent
              <br />
              Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European
              legislator to withdraw his or her consent to processing of his or
              her personal data at any time.
              <br />
              If the data subject wishes to exercise the right to withdraw the
              consent, he or she may at any time directly contact our Data
              Protection Officer of ElitaGame or another employee of ElitaGame.
              In the event that such withdrawal of consent would mean that
              ElitaGame is unable to provide its Services to the data subject,
              such data subject will be notified of the same before any
              termination of the Services.

              A social network is a place for social meetings on the Internet,
              an online community, which usually allows users to communicate
              with each other and interact in a digital space. A social network
              may serve as a platform for the exchange of opinions and
              experiences, or enable the Internet community to provide personal
              or business-related information. Facebook allows social network
              users to include the creation of private profiles, upload photos,
              and network through friend requests.
              <br />
              The operating company of Facebook is Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way,
              Menlo Park, CA 94025, United States. If a person lives outside of
              the United States or Canada, the controller is the Facebook
              Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2,
              Ireland.
              <br />
              With each call-up to one of the individual pages of the Portals,
              which is operated by ElitaGame and into which a Facebook component
              (Facebook plug-ins) was integrated, the web browser on the
              information technology system of the data subject is automatically
              prompted to download display of the corresponding Facebook
              component from Facebook through the Facebook component. An
              overview of all the Facebook Plug-ins may be accessed under
              https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/. During the course
              of this technical procedure, Facebook is made aware of what
              specific sub-site of our Portals was visited by the data subject.
              <br />
              If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook,
              Facebook detects with every call-up to our Portals by the data
              subject—and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet
              site—which specific sub-site of our Internet page was visited by
              the data subject. This information is collected through the
              Facebook component and associated with the respective Facebook
              account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of
              the Facebook buttons integrated into our Portals, e.g. the “Like”
              button, or if the data subject submits a comment, then Facebook
              matches this information with the personal Facebook user account
              of the data subject and stores the personal data.
              <br />
              Facebook always receives, through the Facebook component,
              information about a visit to our Portals by the data subject,
              whenever the data subject is logged in at the same time on
              Facebook during the time of the call-up to our Portals. This
              occurs regardless of whether the data subject clicks on the
              Facebook component or not. If such a transmission of information
              to Facebook is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she
              may prevent this by logging off from their Facebook account before
              a call-up to our Portals is made.
              <br />
              The data protection guideline published by Facebook, which is
              available at https://facebook.com/about/privacy/, provides
              information about the collection, processing and use of personal
              data by Facebook. In addition, it is explained there what setting
              options Facebook offers to protect the privacy of the data
              subject.

              Google Analytics
            </p>
            <p>
              On the Portals, ElitaGame has integrated the component of Google
              Analytics. Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web
              analytics is the collection, gathering, and analysis of data about
              the behavior of visitors to Portalss. A web analysis service
              collects, inter alia, data about the Portals from which a person
              has come (the so-called referrer), which sub-pages were visited,
              or how often and for what duration a sub-page was viewed. Web
              analytics are mainly used for the optimization of a Portals and in
              order to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of Internet
              advertising.
              <br />
              The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc.,
              1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, United
              States.
              <br />
              The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the
              traffic on our Portals. Google uses the collected data and
              information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our Portals and to
              provide online reports, which show the activities on our Portals,
              and to provide other services concerning the use of our Portals
              for us.
              <br />
              Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology
              system of the data subject. The definition of cookies is explained
              above. With the setting of the cookie, Google is enabled to
              analyze the use of our Portals. With each call-up to one of the
              individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by
              ElitaGame and into which a Google Analytics component was
              integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology
              system of the data subject will automatically submit data through
              the Google Analytics component for the purpose of online
              advertising and the settlement of commissions to Google. During
              the course of this technical procedure, the enterprise Google
              gains knowledge of personal information, such as the IP address of
              the data subject, which serves Google, inter alia, to understand
              the origin of visitors and clicks, and subsequently create
              commission settlements.
              <br />
              The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the
              access time, the location from which the access was made, and the
              frequency of visits of our Portals by the data subject. With each
              visit to our Internet site, such personal data, including the IP
              address of the Internet access used by the data subject, will be
              transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These
              personal data are stored by Google in the United States of
              America. Google may pass these personal data collected through the
              technical procedure to third parties.
              <br />
              The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of
              cookies through our Portals at any time by means of a
              corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus
              permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such an adjustment to the
              Internet browser used would also prevent Google Analytics from
              setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data
              subject. In addition, cookies already in use by Google Analytics
              may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software
              programs.
              <br />
              In addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to
              a collection of data that are generated by Google Analytics, which
              is related to the use of this Portals, as well as the processing
              of this data by Google and the chance to preclude any such. For
              this purpose, the data subject must download a browser add-on
              under the link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and
              install it. This browser add-on tells Google Analytics through a
              JavaScript, that any data and information about the visits of
              Internet pages may not be transmitted to Google Analytics. The
              installation of the browser add-ons is considered an objection by
              Google. If the information technology system of the data subject
              is later deleted, formatted, or newly installed, then the data
              subject must reinstall the browser add-ons to disable Google
              Analytics. If the browser add-on was uninstalled by the data
              subject or any other person who is attributable to their sphere of
              competence, or is disabled, it is possible to execute the
              reinstallation or reactivation of the browser add-ons.

              16. Data protection provisions about the application and use of
              Google Remarketing
            </p>
            <p>
              On this Portals, ElitaGame has integrated Google Remarketing
              services. Google Remarketing is a feature of Google AdWords, which
              allows an enterprise to display advertising to Internet users who
              have previously resided on the enterprise’s Internet site. The
              integration of Google Remarketing therefore allows an enterprise
              to create user-based advertising and thus shows relevant
              advertisements to interested Internet users.
              <br />
              The operating company of the Google Remarketing services is the
              Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351,
              United States.
              <br />
              The purpose of Google Remarketing is the insertion of
              interest-relevant advertising. Google Remarketing allows us to
              display ads on the Google network or on other Portalss, which are
              based on individual needs and matched to the interests of Internet
              users.
              <br />
              Google Remarketing sets a cookie on the information technology
              system of the data subject. The definition of cookies is explained
              above. With the setting of the cookie, Google enables a
              recognition of the visitor of our Portals if he calls up
              consecutive web pages, which are also a member of the Google
              advertising network. With each call-up to an Internet site on
              which the service has been integrated by Google Remarketing, the
              web browser of the data subject identifies automatically with
              Google. During the course of this technical procedure, Google
              receives personal information, such as the IP address or the
              surfing behaviour of the user, which Google uses, inter alia, for
              the insertion of interest relevant advertising.
              <br />
              The cookie is used to store personal information, e.g. the
              Internet pages visited by the data subject. Each time we visit our
              Internet pages, personal data, including the IP address of the
              Internet access used by the data subject, is transmitted to Google
              in the United States of America. These personal data are stored by
              Google in the United States of America. Google may pass these
              personal data collected through the technical procedure to third
              parties.
              <br />
              The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of
              cookies through our Portals at any time by means of a
              corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus
              permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such an adjustment to the
              Internet browser used would also prevent Google from setting a
              cookie on the information technology system of the data subject.
              In addition, cookies already in use by Google may be deleted at
              any time via a web browser or other software programs.
              <br />
              In addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to
              the interest-based advertising by Google. For this purpose, the
              data subject must call up the link to www.google.de/settings/ads
              and make the desired settings on each Internet browser used by the
              data subject.

              Google-AdWords
            </p>
            <p>
              On the Portals, ElitaGame has integrated Google AdWords. Google
              AdWords is a service for Internet advertising that allows the
              advertiser to place ads in Google search engine results and the
              Google advertising network. Google AdWords allows an advertiser to
              pre-define specific keywords with the help of which an ad on
              Google’s search results only then displayed, when the user
              utilizes the search engine to retrieve a keyword-relevant search
              result. In the Google Advertising Network, the ads are distributed
              on relevant web pages using an automatic algorithm, taking into
              account the previously defined keywords.
              <br />
              The operating company of Google AdWords is Google Inc., 1600
              Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, UNITED STATES.
              <br />
              The purpose of Google AdWords is the promotion of our Portals by
              the inclusion of relevant advertising on the Portalss of third
              parties and in the search engine results of the search engine
              Google and an insertion of third-party advertising on our Portals.
              If a data subject reaches our Portals via a Google ad, a
              conversion cookie is filed on the information technology system of
              the data subject through Google. The definition of cookies is
              explained above. A conversion cookie loses its validity after 30
              days and is not used to identify the data subject. If the cookie
              has not expired, the conversion cookie is used to check whether
              certain sub-pages, e.g, the shopping cart from an online shop
              system, were called up on our Portals. Through the conversion
              cookie, both Google and ElitaGame can understand whether a person
              who reached an AdWords ad on our Portals generated sales, that is,
              executed or canceled a sale of goods.
              <br />
              The data and information collected through the use of the
              conversion cookie is used by Google to create visit statistics for
              our Portals. These visit statistics are used in order to determine
              the total number of users who have been served through AdWords ads
              to ascertain the success or failure of each AdWords ad and to
              optimize our AdWords ads in the future. Neither our company nor
              other Google AdWords advertisers receive information from Google
              that could identify the data subject.
              <br />
              The conversion cookie stores personal information, e.g. the
              Internet pages visited by the data subject. Each time we visit our
              Internet pages, personal data, including the IP address of the
              Internet access used by the data subject, is transmitted to Google
              in the United States of America. These personal data are stored by
              Google in the United States of America. Google may pass these
              personal data collected through the technical procedure to third
              parties.
              <br />
              The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies
              by our Portals, as stated above, by means of a corresponding
              setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently deny the
              setting of cookies. Such a setting of the Internet browser used
              would also prevent Google from placing a conversion cookie on the
              information technology system of the data subject. In addition, a
              cookie set by Google AdWords may be deleted at any time via the
              Internet browser or other software programs.
              <br />
              The data subject has a possibility of objecting to the interest
              based advertisement of Google. Therefore, the data subject must
              access from each of the browsers in use the link
              www.google.de/settings/ads and set the desired settings.

              ElitaGame has integrated components of the LinkedIn Corporation on
              this Portals. LinkedIn is a web-based social network that enables
              users with existing business contacts to connect and to make new
              business contacts. LinkedIn is currently the largest platform for
              business contacts and one of the most visited Portalss in the
              world.
              <br />
              The operating company of LinkedIn is LinkedIn Corporation, 2029
              Stierlin Court Mountain View, CA 94043, UNITED STATES. For privacy

              Policy Issues, Wilton Plaza, Wilton Place, Dublin 2, Ireland, is
              responsible.
              <br />
              With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet
              site, which is operated by ElitaGame and on which a LinkedIn
              component (LinkedIn plug-in) was integrated, the Internet browser
              on the information technology system of the data subject is
              automatically prompted to the download of a display of the
              corresponding LinkedIn component of LinkedIn. Further information
              about the LinkedIn plug-in may be accessed under
              https://developer.linkedin.com/plugins. During the course of this
              technical procedure, LinkedIn gains knowledge of what specific
              sub-page of our Portals was visited by the data subject.
              <br />
              If the data subject is logged in at the same time on LinkedIn,
              LinkedIn detects with every call-up to our Portals by the data
              subject—and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet
              site—which specific sub-page of our Internet page was visited by
              the data subject. This information is collected through the
              LinkedIn component and associated with the respective LinkedIn
              account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of
              the LinkedIn buttons integrated on our Portals, then LinkedIn
              assigns this information to the personal LinkedIn user account of
              the data subject and stores the personal data.

              LinkedIn receives information via the LinkedIn component that the
              data subject has visited our Portals, provided that the data
              subject is logged in at LinkedIn at the time of the call-up to our
              Portals. This occurs regardless of whether the person clicks on
              the LinkedIn button or not. If such a transmission of information
              to LinkedIn is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she
              may prevent this by logging off from their LinkedIn account before
              a call-up to our Portals is made.

              19. Data protection provisions about the application and use of
              Twitter
            </p>
            <p>
              On the Portals, ElitaGame has integrated components of Twitter.
              Twitter messages (tweets) are available for everyone, including
              those who are not logged on to Twitter. The tweets are also
              displayed to so-called followers of the respective user. Followers
              are other Twitter users who follow a user’s tweets. Furthermore,
              Twitter allows data subjects to address a wide audience via
              hashtags, links or retweets.
              <br />
              The operating company of Twitter is Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market
              Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, UNITED STATES.
              <br />
              With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet
              site, which is operated by ElitaGame and on which a Twitter
              component (Twitter button) was integrated, the Internet browser on
              the information technology system of the data subject is
              automatically prompted to download a display of the corresponding
              Twitter component of Twitter. Further information about the
              Twitter buttons is available under
              https://about.twitter.com/de/resources/buttons. During the course
              of this technical procedure, Twitter gains knowledge of what
              specific sub-page of our Portals was visited by the data subject.
              The purpose of the integration of the Twitter component is a
              re-transmission of the contents of this website to allow our users
              to introduce this web page to the digital world and increase our
              visitor numbers.
              <br />
              If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Twitter,
              Twitter detects with every call-up to our Portals by the data
              subject and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet
              site which specific sub-page of our Internet page was visited by
              the data subject. This information is collected through the
              Twitter component and associated with the respective Twitter
              account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of
              the Twitter buttons integrated on our Portals, then Twitter
              assigns this information to the personal Twitter user account of
              the data subject and stores the personal data.
              <br />
              Twitter receives information via the Twitter component that the
              data subject has visited our Portals, provided that the data
              subject is logged in on Twitter at the time of the call-up to our
              Portals. This occurs regardless of whether the person clicks on
              the Twitter component or not. If such a transmission of
              information to Twitter is not desirable for the data subject, then
              he or she may prevent this by logging off from their Twitter
              account before a call-up to our Portals is made. The applicable
              data protection provisions of Twitter may be accessed under
              https://twitter.com/privacy?lang=en.

              20. Legal basis for the processing
            </p>
            <p>
              Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing
              operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing
              purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the
              performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as
              is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary
              for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the
              processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies
              to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out
              pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries
              concerning our products or services. If our company is subject to
              a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is
              required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the
              processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the
              processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital
              interests of the data subject or of another natural person. This
              would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our
              company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital
              information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or
              other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1)
              lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on
              Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing
              operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned
              legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the
              legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party,
              except where such interests are overridden by the interests or
              fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require
              protection of personal data. Such processing operations are
              particularly permissible because they have been specifically
              mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a
              legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a
              client of ElitaGame (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).

              Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) of

              • To identifying criminal or suspicious transactions or threats to
              public safety;

              • To improve or enhance the operations of ElitaGame, and the

            <p>
              The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal
              data is the respective statutory retention period. After
              expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely
              deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment
              of the contract or the initiation of a contract.

              requirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a contract;
              Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data;
              possible consequences of failure to provide such data
            </p>
            <p>
              We clarify that the provision of personal data may be required by
              law (e.g. tax regulations) or may also result from contractual
              provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner).
              Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data
              subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be
              processed by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to
              provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract
              with him or her. The non-provision of the personal data would have
              the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not
              be concluded. Before personal data is provided by the data
              subject, the data subject must contact our Data Protection
              Officer. Our Data Protection Officer clarifies to the data subject
              whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or
              contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract,
              whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and
              the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.
